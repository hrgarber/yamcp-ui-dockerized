# Project Vision and Requirements

## Core Vision
Build a cloud-native MCP (Model Context Protocol) hub that replicates YAMCP's workspace aggregation functionality, making it accessible from any environment via HTTP/SSE endpoints.

## User Problem Statement
- **Pain Point**: Managing MCP configurations across multiple environments (Mac, Windows, WSL) is cumbersome
- **Current State**: Each environment requires separate MCP server setup and configuration
- **User Goal**: Configure once, access from anywhere via a single endpoint per workspace

## Key Requirements

### 1. Workspace Aggregation (CRITICAL)
- **Core Functionality**: Multiple MCP servers â†’ One unified endpoint
- **Tool Discovery**: Aggregate `tools/list` responses from all servers in workspace
- **Request Routing**: Route tool calls to the correct backend server
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle duplicate tool names across servers
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when individual servers fail

### 2. Network Accessibility
- **Protocol**: HTTP/SSE endpoints for real-time streaming
- **Discovery**: Each workspace accessible at `/mcp/:workspaceName`
- **Cross-Platform**: Accessible from Mac, Windows, WSL environments
- **Authentication**: Basic security for network exposure

### 3. Configuration Management
- **Interface**: Existing YAMCP-UI web dashboard for server/workspace management
- **Hot Reloading**: Changes reflected without manual restarts
- **Persistence**: Configuration survives container restarts
- **Validation**: Prevent invalid configurations

### 4. Reliability & Operations
- **Process Management**: Automatic restart of failed servers
- **Health Monitoring**: Server status and connection health
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Clean termination of all processes

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Metrics
1. **Workspace Aggregation Works**: Multiple servers appear as one unified MCP endpoint
2. **Tool Discovery Complete**: All tools from all servers visible to clients
3. **Request Routing Functional**: Tool calls reach correct backend server
4. **Cross-Environment Access**: Same workspace accessible from Mac/Windows/WSL

### Secondary Success Metrics
1. **Configuration Hot Reload**: Changes via UI reflected in active workspaces
2. **Error Recovery**: Individual server failures don't break entire workspace
3. **Performance**: Sub-second response times for tool discovery and execution
4. **Documentation**: Clear setup and usage instructions

## Non-Requirements (Out of Scope)
- **Multi-User Support**: Single-user/team usage initially
- **Advanced Authentication**: Basic network security only
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Single-instance deployment
- **Complex Load Balancing**: Simple round-robin if needed
- **Database Persistence**: File-based configuration sufficient

## Architecture Constraints
- **Existing Infrastructure**: Must work with current YAMCP-UI setup
- **Docker Deployment**: Container-based deployment required
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Leverage existing tools (PM2, Express, React)
- **Protocol Compatibility**: Must work with existing MCP clients

## User Workflows

### Primary Workflow: Configure and Access
1. User opens YAMCP-UI web interface
2. User configures MCP servers (context7, github, filesystem)
3. User creates workspace pointing to multiple servers
4. User saves configuration (triggers hot reload)
5. User connects MCP client to `http://hub:8765/mcp/workspace-name`
6. Client discovers all tools from all servers as unified list
7. Client executes tools, hub routes to correct server

### Secondary Workflow: Development and Debugging
1. Developer adds new MCP server to workspace
2. System automatically starts new server process
3. Developer tests tool availability via `/tools/list`
4. Developer debugs issues via server logs
5. Developer modifies configuration, system hot reloads

## Technical Requirements

### Performance Requirements
- **Startup Time**: Workspace available within 10 seconds of configuration
- **Tool Discovery**: Complete tool list returned within 2 seconds
- **Tool Execution**: Tool calls routed within 500ms
- **Memory Usage**: <1GB RAM for typical workspace (3-5 servers)

### Reliability Requirements
- **Uptime**: 99% availability for running workspaces
- **Recovery**: Failed servers restart within 30 seconds
- **Data Integrity**: Configuration changes never corrupt existing workspaces
- **Graceful Degradation**: Workspace partially functional if some servers fail

### Security Requirements
- **Network Binding**: Configurable network interface (localhost vs 0.0.0.0)
- **Input Validation**: Prevent code injection via configuration
- **Process Isolation**: Server processes isolated from each other
- **Log Security**: No secrets logged in plain text

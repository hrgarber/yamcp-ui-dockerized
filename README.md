# YAMCP UI Dashboard - Dockerized

> This is a dockerized fork of [yamcp-ui](https://github.com/eladcandroid/yamcp-ui) that runs in development mode, bypassing yamcp module compatibility issues.

A beautiful web-based dashboard for [YAMCP (Yet Another MCP)](https://github.com/hamidra/yamcp) - A Model Context Protocol workspace manager.

## Overview

YAMCP UI provides an intuitive web interface to manage your MCP servers, workspaces, and configurations. Built as a standalone npm package that integrates seamlessly with YAMCP.

## Docker Installation & Usage (Recommended)

The easiest way to run YAMCP UI without dealing with dependencies:

```bash
# Clone this dockerized version
git clone https://github.com/hrgarber/yamcp-ui-dockerized.git
cd yamcp-ui-dockerized

# Run with Docker
cd docker
docker-compose up -d
```

Access the application:
- üé® **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173 (with hot reloading)
- üîß **Backend API**: http://localhost:8765

Stop the container:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

#### Building the Image Manually

If you prefer to build the Docker image directly without using Docker Compose:

```bash
# Navigate to the project root directory (yamcp-ui-dockerized)
docker build -t yamcp-ui-dev -f docker/Dockerfile .
```

Then you can run it using `docker run`, making sure to map ports and volumes as defined in the `docker-compose.yml`.
For example:
```bash
docker run -d -p 5173:5173 -p 8765:8765 \
  -v yamcp-ui-data:/root/.local/share/yamcp-nodejs \
  -v $(pwd)/src:/app/src \
  -v $(pwd)/index.html:/app/index.html \
  -v $(pwd)/server.mjs:/app/server.mjs \
  --name yamcp-ui-dev-manual yamcp-ui-dev
```
Note: `$(pwd)` assumes you are in the project root.

### Benefits of Docker Version
- ‚úÖ No yamcp installation required
- ‚úÖ No module compatibility issues
- ‚úÖ Hot reloading for development
- ‚úÖ Isolated environment
- ‚úÖ Easy to start and stop

## Original Installation & Usage (Non-Docker)

```bash

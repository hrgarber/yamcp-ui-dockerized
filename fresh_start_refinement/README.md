# Fresh Start Refinement: Technical Specifications

**Status**: In Progress  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-11

## Overview

This directory contains detailed technical specifications that transform high-level ideas into implementable designs. Every "how exactly?" question is answered here before any code is written.

## Document Status

### Core Specifications
- [ ] Protocol Specification - MCP SSE format documentation
- [ ] Process Communication - IPC method decision with rationale
- [ ] Component Boundaries - Clear system decomposition
- [ ] Configuration Schemas - Complete format documentation

### Integration Specifications
- [ ] State Management - Where and how state lives
- [ ] Error Handling - Comprehensive error matrix
- [ ] Message Flow - Request/response diagrams

### Implementation Guidance
- [x] AI Delegation Strategy - Which AI builds what
- [x] Acceptance Criteria - Clear success metrics
- [ ] Interface Contracts - Component integration specs
- [ ] Testing Strategy - How to test each component

## Key Decisions Made

1. **FastMCP for Aggregation** - Provides built-in workspace aggregation
2. **Component-Based Architecture** - Clear boundaries for AI delegation
3. **Progressive Refinement** - Spec first, implement later

## How to Use This Documentation

### For Planning
1. Start with `research_plan.md` to understand objectives
2. Review `00_gaps_analysis.md` for what needs specification
3. Check each directory for detailed specifications

### For Implementation
1. Each specification provides concrete answers
2. No design decisions needed during coding
3. Clear acceptance criteria for each component

### For Delegation
1. See `human_request.md` for AI tool assignments
2. Review `delegation/interface_contracts.md` for integration specs
3. Use `acceptance_criteria.md` to verify completeness

## Current Focus

Documenting technical specifications to answer:
- Exact protocol formats and message structures
- Concrete architecture decisions with evidence
- Clear component boundaries and interfaces
- Comprehensive error handling strategies

## Next Steps

Once specifications are complete:
1. Create step-by-step implementation plan
2. Generate code templates for each component
3. Set up development environment
4. Begin systematic implementation

The goal: Make implementation purely mechanical with no design decisions during coding.

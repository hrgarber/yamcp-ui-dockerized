# Research Plan: Fresh Start Refinement Session

**Created**: 2025-01-11  
**Purpose**: Define concrete research and refinement tasks for this session

## Session Goal

Transform high-level ideas from `fresh_start_ideas/` into detailed specifications that enable mechanical implementation. Focus on answering all "how exactly?" questions before any code is written.

## Key Research Areas

### 1. Protocol Specification Research
**Goal**: Document exact MCP SSE protocol format
- Research MCP specification documentation
- Find examples of actual MCP messages
- Document all message types and formats
- Specify error response structures

### 2. Architecture Decision Research  
**Goal**: Make concrete architecture decisions with evidence
- Evaluate process communication options (stdio, HTTP, socket)
- Document trade-offs with specific metrics
- Choose approach with clear rationale
- Define exact integration patterns

### 3. Component Boundary Definition
**Goal**: Define clear interfaces for AI delegation
- Break system into discrete, delegatable components
- Specify exact inputs/outputs for each component
- Define integration contracts between components
- Map components to appropriate AI tools

### 4. State Management Strategy
**Goal**: Define where and how state is managed
- Workspace configuration state
- Process lifecycle state
- Connection state
- Error state and recovery

### 5. Configuration Schema Documentation
**Goal**: Document exact configuration formats
- Current YAMCP-UI configuration structure
- Required FastMCP configuration format
- Transformation logic between formats
- Validation rules and defaults

### 6. Error Handling Taxonomy
**Goal**: Comprehensive error handling strategy
- Catalog all possible error scenarios
- Define recovery strategies for each
- Specify user-facing error messages
- Design error propagation between layers

### 7. Testing Strategy Definition
**Goal**: Define how each component will be tested
- Unit test requirements
- Integration test scenarios
- Performance benchmarks
- Mock server specifications

## Deliverables for This Session

### Core Specifications
1. `protocols/mcp_sse_specification.md` - Complete protocol documentation
2. `architecture/process_communication_decision.md` - IPC choice with rationale
3. `architecture/component_boundaries.md` - System decomposition
4. `schemas/configuration_formats.md` - All config structures

### Integration Specifications  
5. `integration/state_management.md` - State handling strategy
6. `integration/error_handling_matrix.md` - Error scenarios and responses
7. `integration/message_flow_diagrams.md` - Request/response flows

### Implementation Guidance
8. `delegation/ai_assignment_matrix.md` - Which AI builds what
9. `delegation/interface_contracts.md` - Component integration specs
10. `testing/test_strategy.md` - Testing approach for each component

## Research Methods

### For Protocol Research
- Review MCP specification documents
- Analyze existing MCP implementations
- Document message examples
- Create validation rules

### For Architecture Decisions
- Research IPC performance characteristics
- Document pros/cons of each approach
- Define selection criteria
- Make reasoned choice

### For Component Design
- Apply single responsibility principle
- Define clear boundaries
- Minimize coupling
- Maximize cohesion

## Success Criteria

This refinement phase is complete when:
- [ ] Every technical question has a concrete answer
- [ ] All architecture decisions are made with rationale
- [ ] Component interfaces are fully specified
- [ ] Error scenarios are comprehensively cataloged
- [ ] Testing approach is clearly defined
- [ ] Implementation can proceed without design decisions

## What This Session Will NOT Do

- Write any implementation code
- Create full technical documentation
- Build prototypes or POCs
- Set up development environment
- Make technology stack decisions beyond architecture

## Next Steps After This Session

With completed refinement, the next session can:
1. Create implementation plan with exact steps
2. Generate code templates for each component
3. Set up development environment
4. Begin systematic implementation

The goal is to make implementation purely mechanical - no thinking, just executing the refined plan.
